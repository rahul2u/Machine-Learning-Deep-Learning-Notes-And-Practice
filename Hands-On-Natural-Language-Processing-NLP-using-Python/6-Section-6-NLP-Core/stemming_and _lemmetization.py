#  Stemming and Lemmatiztion
# Why stemming and lemmatization - same word diffrent form have diffrent meaning for  computer so we convert root or same form of word.

# stemming -Stemming is process of  reducing the infected words to their words stem,base or root form.
# example -going  =go
#         goes = go
#         gone = go

'''

So we are not duplicating different words when we have the same word in different forms.
We are not taking those words as different words rather than we are taking them as the same word.
So this has problems.

The problem is that intermediate words that are represented in case of stemming may not have any meaning

whatsoever.
So you know this word intelligent has no meaning.

Similarly when you are stemming the word final finally and so on you would find out that you get a word

called Feiner and it means nothing right.

It just means nothing.
Example-intelligen ,fina

''' 
Lemmatization -Same as steamming but intermediate representation/root form has a meaning
Example - intelligence -intelligent
          intelligent - intelligent 
          intelligently

'''

'''
Stemmming - words root or intermediate representing word may be meaning full or may be not 
Lemmatization - words are  root or intermediate representing word  meaning full 100 % or dictionary words.

When use lemmatization or when use steamming.
